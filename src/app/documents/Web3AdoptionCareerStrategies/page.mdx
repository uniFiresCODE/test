## Introduction

As part of the uniFiers team, a project that connects communities across different chains to grow together, we held an online workshop on April 18th. This time, we focused on a specific group of people: Creators.

Who are the creators of web3? How can we attract more of them? What obstacles do they need to overcome? And how can we make it easier for them?

## Web3 Creators

This diverse group of innovative people includes developers, artists, entrepreneurs, and designers. They build decentralized applications (dApps), create digital art as NFTs, and use blockchain technology to make systems that are open, secure, and accessible to everyone. Their work is changing how we think about ownership and value in the digital age. It mixes technology and creativity, aiming to give users more power.


Special thanks to everyone who joined the call to help us find answers, share opinions, and enjoy this time together. Participants: Felix, Jeeper, Jenny, Linda, Peter Wolcott, Paul Spata, and Thomas Art. Each guest can be considered a creator, each in their field.

## What are the differences between creators in web2 and web3?

We first discussed this question to define these two groups' differences better. It will help us to clarify issues, find benefits, and better understand the topic and suggestions we can come up with.

1. Increased Competition: The accessibility of web3 brings significantly heightened competition, requiring creators to differentiate themselves more distinctly.
2. Direct Compensation: web3 offers creators direct compensation models, which is especially beneficial for those in previously non-profitable sectors. It also offers new ways for creators to make money, like through cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
3. Security and Ownership: Blockchain technology in web3 ensures that art is permanently linked to its creator, enhancing authenticity and recognition. Creators have more control over their work as in Web2 platforms often control distribution and profits.
4. Reduced Gatekeeping: Web3 removes many traditional barriers, such as the need for merchant accounts, making it easier for creators to share their work.
5. Distinct Audiences: The audience for web3 art remains distinct from traditional art circles, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for engagement.
6. Development of Tools and Platforms: As web3 is still emerging, creators participate not only in creating but also in defining the tools and platforms that will shape future creative processes.
7. Overall, web3 provides more power and possibilities for creators, but it also requires them to navigate a new and complex system.

## Sources of creator struggle when entering web3

We asked our creators directly to tell us about their experience. This question sparked interesting discussion and raised many points that we can identify as weaknesses. Entering the web3 ecosystem presents several challenges for creators.

* Abundance of information: Many find it overwhelming, making it difficult to focus and decide what to learn. In some cases, it's the exact opposite: lack of proper documentation and sources of information.

Lack of clear onboarding processes and adequate documentation complicates understanding technical aspects, such as minting NFTs and engaging with communities.

* The technical nature of blockchain and cryptocurrencies: This can be daunting, particularly for those who need to be versed in technology.
Effective marketing and brand building: This crucial yet challenging point requires navigation through complex promotional strategies without clear guidelines.
* Security concerns and trust issues: Widespread problems creating anxiety around transaction safety and platform reliability, posing significant barriers to fully embracing web3 technologies. These challenges underscore the need for improved support structures and educational resources to facilitate a smoother transition for creators into the web3 space.
These challenges highlight the need for better support structures and educational resources within the web3 community to help creators transition more smoothly into this new digital landscape.

## What should change?
We identified a few areas that should change to make it easier for creators to join and thrive in the web3 ecosystem.

1. User-Friendly Design: Platforms should be intuitive and easy to use, so creators can focus on creating and selling their work without needing extensive technical knowledge.
2. Better Documentation and Onboarding: Clear, simple instructions and onboarding processes should be available to help creators understand the basics of web3, from minting NFTs to managing transactions.
3. Improved Security Measures: Stronger protections against scams and fraud should be implemented to make the ecosystem safer for new users.
4. Cross-Chain Collaboration: Making it easier for creators to work across different blockchain systems without having to commit to just one, promoting flexibility and exploration.
5. Simplified Language and Communication: Using plain language in communications and tutorials to make technical concepts more accessible to everyone, regardless of their prior knowledge.
6. Community Support: Establishing roles or teams dedicated to helping new creators through processes like onboarding, marketing, and selling their work.
Partnerships with Traditional Institutions: Collaborating with established art galleries and museums to bridge the gap between traditional and digital art markets.

There is nothing better than putting together people who are experts in their field and opening discussions about real problems and important topics. We are all part of the web3 community, and we should think less about our different networks and start focusing on users in general.
