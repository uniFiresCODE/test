## Introduction

Why is education needed to drive web3 adoption? Who needs to be educated, and how? In this article, we will go through these topics and focus on the web3 adoption workshop that happened last month.


## What can we have if we drive education about web3?

Bridging the knowledge gap to achieve mass adoption of web3 technologies is the key. Web3 technologies, including blockchain and decentralized applications, are too complex for normal users and people working with them. Education helps demystify these technologies, making them accessible to a broader audience.

Thanks to education, we can build trust. We can teach people about security and privacy, and the decentralized nature of Web3 builds trust. People are more likely to adopt technologies they understand and can trust. And we need to know more about the product to be willing to trust it.

With proper knowledge, developers and entrepreneurs can innovate more effectively, creating new solutions and applications within the Web3 ecosystem. Educating regulators and policymakers ensures that regulations are supportive and conducive to growth rather than restrictive.

## Education groups

* Regular users: Focuses on basic concepts and practical usage. Users need to understand the importance of decentralized systems, how to set up wallets, and how to secure their digital assets. Tutorials and step-by-step guides are essential. Additionally, highlighting the benefits of privacy, ownership, and control in Web3 can help users see the value of adopting these technologies.
* Developers: Developers require in-depth knowledge and experience with Web3 technologies. Education for this group should include detailed courses on blockchain programming, smart contract development, and decentralized application (dApp) creation. Hackathons, coding boot camps, and comprehensive documentation play crucial roles in building and securing efficient Web3 solutions.
* Entrepreneurs: Entrepreneurs need to be educated on how to leverage Web3 technologies to create innovative business models. This involves understanding tokenomics, fundraising through ICOs or STOs, and the regulatory landscape.
* Education: Education of regulators and policymakers: This group of people have a huge effect on markets and development. It is crucial for projects in web3 to be able to offer solutions that can positively change the perception of this group.

It is also important to realize that each person prefers other ways of learning. Some people spend hours reading and exploring, some likes to watch and other don’t even wanna think about education.


## How do we achieve web3 adoption via education?
Options are countless; there are many examples of projects, initiatives, and people focused on education. And there is never enough education; we learn during the process. So, how can we help

* Collaborative Efforts
* Accessible Content
* Community Engagement
* Certification Programs
* Promotion: Influencers
* Fun: Educate people via activities they will perceive as fun
* Spark curiosity

There are many things we use or do without thinking. While our grandparents have problems using computers and phones, our kids don't hesitate to use and navigate in apps that we never saw before. We can expect that with time, Web3 space, cryptocurrencies, and all the amazing technologies and projects that are currently being created will become a daily standard for our future generations. Changes are happening faster than we think.

## Education strategies workshop

A few weeks ago, on the 30th of April 2024, various participants from both the Cardano and Polkadot ecosystems joined this workshop. Which strategies were participants seeing as the best ones?

Filippo, a technical educator at Web3 Foundation with a lot of experience, told us that his strategy is to not bore and to simplify to the point of even losing technical meaning. It is important to stoke the learner's curiosity. Simple stories or personal experiences can help others understand even more complicated topics. James, a developer and technical educator in Cardano, told us about historic educational patterns that teach humans to take commands (and that is largely what people want).

You are in the right place if you are curious to learn more about web3 adoption. UniFires — ambassadors from both projects: Cardano and Polkadot ecosystems! Join our Discord and help us share knowledge!
